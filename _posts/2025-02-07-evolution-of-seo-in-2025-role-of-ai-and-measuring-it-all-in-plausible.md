It’s an interesting time to be an online business, catching up with rapidly shifting “trends” regarding AI, increasing concerns around consumer privacy, and the one you can’t miss: shifting SEO –– one of the most favourite channels of digital marketers for more than two decades.

Some people on LinkedIn and other niche communities claim how “SEO is dead” (trust me, that’s been a pretty common thrown-around phrase), others beg to differ and encourage to adapt.

Meanwhile AI is being adopted more and more all over the world, privacy-conscious users are increasing, and it can all feel overwhelming. We try to take an objective view at everything and provide answers to what SEO looks like in 2025, how to adapt, what are some things to take care of, and how to measure it all in Plausible.

## Is SEO dead in 2025?

This is a good time to revisit what SEO even means. “Search Engine Optimization” is the method of optimizing whatever content you push on the web in a way that search engines like to present it (preferably on the first page of search results) to the people who search for related queries.

There are essentially two parts of this “optimization.” One is hunting keywords to understand what people are asking on search engines and if relevant to you, writing content to offer answers to those questions. Second is making the content presentable, easily readable, accessible, etc. (the on-page, off-page and technical SEO bit of it).

The second part is something that content makers should anyway do, i.e. provide a good reading experience. But what lies at the core of all of it is the first part. So let’s break that down by asking three questions:

**Have people stopped asking questions on the web?** 

Not at all (have you?).

**Is the place and the way everyone searches for answers on the web evolving?** 

Certainly. Think AI chatbots, privacy-first browsers, etc.

**Has your overall organic traffic dropped?**

Hmm, moment of truth. So, I decided to check ours at Plausible. I simply compared the last 12 months’ organic search traffic and it’s actually increased by 12%.

[Last 3 months](https://plausible.io/plausible.io?f=is,channel,Organic%20Search&period=custom&keybindHint=C&from=2024-11-01&to=2025-01-31) looked stable too. Since Google is the main organic search source that sends the most traffic and is generally equated with SEO, I just looked at traffic sent by Google searches, and the patterns are still similar for us.

If click-through rates from Google search result pages should have been dropping (because SEO is supposed to be dead and AI overviews are the new normal), it didn’t seem to affect us at least.

Not a good sample size but since we seem to be on the “safer” side, this meets our purpose of continuing the study on what is working if SEO is not.

So, traffic has been stable and growing from organic searches. Next, we look at the breakdown of organic sources. Apart from Google, it shows some sources like DuckDuckGo, Brave, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.
