When you first see your bounce rate of x%, it can be confusing making you think about what it is, is it good to have a higher or lower bounce rate, how is it being calculated for my site, what are some industry benchmarks, what can I do to improve it, etc. Let’s answer all questions.

## Understanding Bounce Rate

Imagine you have a website with ten [web pages](https://plausible.io/blog/analyzing-landing-pages#what-is-a-landing-page). You get visitors from different sources like social media, paid campaigns, organic search, referrals, etc.

You ideally want these visitors to engage with your website and maybe take some necessary actions like signing up. For that to happen, the visitors would need to take any of the following actions:

* Engage with more than one page.
* Take a conversion action.

Essentially, the percentage of visitors who are not taking any of these actions during their [sessions](https://plausible.io/docs/metrics-definitions#total-visits-or-sessions) is the bounce rate. A visitor to a website is said to have “bounced” away when they leave without interacting further with your website.

They could leave by pressing the back button of their browser, closing the tab, or going to another website. Website owners should typically aim for low bounce rates.

High bounce rates indicate low user engagement, meaning visitors may not be finding your content engaging or relevant enough to explore further.

### Bounce rate formula

Bounce Rate = (Total single-page sessions / Total Sessions​) * 100

Where:

* Total single-page sessions is the number of sessions in which users only visited one page before leaving the website.
* Total sessions is the total number of sessions for that page or website.

This formula gives a percentage indicating how often visitors leave immediately after arriving. The bounce rate metric is key to understanding engagement on a specific page or site.

In addition to this, if a visitor takes specified actions on the website, and even if they don’t visit another page, it is still considered an engaged session and doesn’t count towards the bounce rate.

### Bounce rate vs Engagement rate vs Exit rate

Bounce rate is the opposite of engagement rate. If you measure the percentage of visitors who engage, i.e. take any of the aforementioned actions, with your website in a specific time period, you will get your engagement rate.

The exit rate is the percentage of visitors who leave a website from a specific page, regardless of whether they engaged with the content or navigated through other parts of the site before exiting. This helps in understanding the top most pages from which your visitors typically exit the site.

Optimizing these metrics is critical for enhancing user experience and, ultimately, conversion rates.

## What is considered a good bounce rate in 2025?

The general understanding is that lower the bounce rate, the better it is. It is because this means that your entry pages are capable of prompting visitors to engage with the site and that you are attracting the right kind of audience.

But it also depends. It depends how much bounce rate you should be expecting based on:

* The industry you are operating in.
* Whether you deal in B2B or B2C.
* The nature of the entry page from which visitors bounce off. 

Let’s see why.

### Bounce rate benchmarks by industry (in descending order)

Bounce rates vary significantly by industry and the type of entry page.

We have created these ranges based on reported average bounce rates from studies conducted by digital marketing agencies and tools like HubSpot, Siege Media, etc.

#### Content websites and pages: 65% - 90%

Content sites or such pages/sections in a website like blog, news portal, glossary, references, help articles, often have the highest bounce rates.

For eg. A visitor clicks on an interesting news piece about a new scientific discovery from their social media feed, reads that particular piece, and leaves the site. Generally, there’s no other engagement involved.

If, however, the site engages users with gated content, mandatory forms, etc., the bounce rate becomes moderate, reaching as low as 30%. But, these strategies shouldn’t be employed for the sake of reducing bounce rates and the priority should always be creating people-first content.

#### Landing pages: 60% - 90%

Landing pages are designed for conversions. Counter-intuitive but landing pages experience one of the highest bounce rates and there’s a lot of room for improvement. It is surely a red flag and what needs to be optimized is highly contextual.

For eg. You may need to communicate the value of a particular feature better through the landing page, make it less annoying if there are too many calls-to-action or desperate attempts to sell, or it may so happen that it is a single-page site of a freelancer and that’s why it experiences a high bounce rate by default.

#### Service industry websites (Legal, Automotive, etc.): 50% - 70%

Service-based sites generally have moderate bounce rates, as visitors may be researching but not immediately ready to contact or convert.

#### B2B websites: 25% - 65%

B2B sites tend to have lower bounce rates as users often conduct thorough research and may view multiple pages before making decisions.

If your B2B site’s bounce rate is less than 30%, you are doing a great job.

#### Travel and Hospitality: 40% - 60%

Visitors research and compare various options, which can lead to moderately high bounce rates, although this can vary based on page type.

#### Real Estate: 30% - 55%

Real estate sites see varying bounce rates, with users frequently engaging with multiple listings and search filters.

#### Retail & eCommerce websites: 20% - 55%

Retail and eCommerce sites usually have lower bounce rates as most visitors browse products, explore options, check details, create wishlists, share products, etc. Even if they don’t make a purchase, the high engagement rates make them have one of the lowest bounce rates across industries.

### A rule of thumb to go by

Looking at the ranges above, your bounce rates can vary anywhere from 20% to 90%, depending upon your industry and types of pages.

We believe a good benchmark for bounce rate is **aiming for 50% or lower** across your entire site. This indicates that visitors are finding your content engaging and are encouraged to explore the site.

## How to check my website’s Bounce rate?

To check your bounce rate, your traffic needs to be analyzed for some time and for that you need a web analytics tool like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics). When you implement Plausible on your site, bounce rate is available as a key metric at the top of the dashboard by default, with no special configurations needed.

Check out our website’s live stats [here](https://plausible.io/plausible.io) to get a glimpse. You will also be able to see the percentage increase or decrease in the bounce rate over the selected time range and analyze your growth patterns.

You can also monitor the bounce rate for individual pages, specific segments, or particular sections of your site.

## Interpreting bounce rate data

So you found your site’s bounce rate. What about individual pages as each of them would have different bounce rates? What about the sessions acquired through your traffic sources.

It is very easy to segment your bounce rates by plenty of different dimensions tracked for your site. Even a combination of different filters (essentially creating [audience segments](https://plausible.io/audience-segmentation)) is possible.

By segmenting bounce rates by page, source, device, etc., you can also see how your metrics compare to the site’s average bounce rate.

### Segment bounce rate by pages

The bounce rate can tell you a lot about how your page is performing. It reveals whether or not visitors are engaged with your content and if they view other pages on your website or complete conversion actions, after landing on the initial page.

In Plausible, you get a [“Top Pages” report](https://plausible.io/blog/analyzing-landing-pages#top-entry-and-exit-pages) out of the box. Clicking the associated “Details” button shows the bounce rate for each page separately. You can even sort your list of pages by bounce rate in ascending or descending order.

Clicking on any entry (or using the Filter option) in this report segments your dashboard and all metrics by the sessions associated with that page view.

For eg., We compared the bounce rate on our sign-up page in Plausible between Q2 and Q3 of 2024.
