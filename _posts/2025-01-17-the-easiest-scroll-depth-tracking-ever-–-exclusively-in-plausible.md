Scroll depth tracking has always been a crucial metric for understanding how visitors engage with your web pages. It helps you see how far down a page users scroll, helping understand the content performance, engagement levels, and areas for improvement.

Setting up scroll tracking has always been a tedious process ‚Äì no matter which tool you switched to. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) only offers basic tracking at 90% depth as part of their enhanced measurement, which is only useful in knowing whether visitors are scrolling all the way down or not.

To track other percentages, like 25, 50 or 75 percent, you need to set up custom events in Google Tag Manager ‚Äì a time-consuming process.

Whereas other alternatives such as Matomo, Cloudflare, etc. either don‚Äôt allow tracking this metric or require complicated and technical setups and/or custom reporting to track scroll depth.

At Plausible, we‚Äôve simplified this completely. Scroll depth tracking is now built into our analytics by default, requiring no setup or additional configurations.

We automatically track and display all percentages to which your visitors scroll to. Available at no extra cost, this feature is live in your dashboard and ready to provide actionable insights.

Happy new year! üçª

## What is scroll depth?

Simple as the name suggests, scroll depth is the vertical length to which a visitor scrolls a particular page on your website. This metric is often reported as a percentage, such as 25, 50, 75, or 100 percent.



If they scroll down all the way down to the page, it‚Äôs a 100% scrolling event. If half, 50%. And so on. This insight helps you:

* Understand visitor engagement by offering insights into how visitors interact with your content, identifying which sections capture attention and which are overlooked.
* Optimize content placement by determining the ideal locations for important elements like calls-to-action, ensuring they are positioned where users are most likely to see them.
* Improve page layout by analyzing scroll patterns.

For example, if you‚Äôve got a long-form article with a call-to-action (CTA) near the bottom, scroll depth can tell you how many of your readers actually made it to that point.

This is also measured in pixels (usually rounded off values) in some tools. Although, it‚Äôs better to track it in percentages because that way it‚Äôs easier to judge the engagement level of the page and easily compare it to other pages too.
