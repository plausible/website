According to multiple users’ reports, the referral traffic from ChatGPT has been declining since July 21 and more so after 7 August (i.e. the launch of GPT-5).

According to this LinkedIn post, the decline of referral traffic is at 52%. They analyzed 1+ Billion ChatGPT citations and 1+ million referral visits from ChatGPT. They found that this is because of the citations by ChatGPT being shrunk down to only a few reliable, answer-first, people-first information sources.

The major sites being cited now are Wikipedia, Reddit and TechRadar. These are the ones providing neutral, and/or opinionated recommendations to products and sharing information. Apparently, 1 in 5 ChatGPT citations are now going to just these three sites.

Naturally, we checked what was going on at Plausible and we have a few cents to add to what’s going on.
