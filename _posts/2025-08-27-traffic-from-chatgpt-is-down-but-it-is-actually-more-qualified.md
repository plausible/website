According to multiple users’ reports, the referral traffic from ChatGPT has been declining since July 21 and more so after 7 August (i.e. the launch of GPT-5).

According to this LinkedIn post, the decline of referral traffic is at 52%. They analyzed 1+ Billion ChatGPT citations and 1+ million referral visits from ChatGPT. They found that this is because of the citations by ChatGPT being shrunk down to only a few reliable, answer-first, people-first information sources.

The major sites being cited now are Wikipedia, Reddit and TechRadar. These are the ones providing neutral, and/or opinionated recommendations to products and sharing information. Apparently, 1 in 5 ChatGPT citations are now going to just these three sites.

Naturally, we checked what was going on at Plausible and we have our two cents to add to what’s going on.

## The fall of ChatGPT referral traffic

Below is the screenshot of our [live Plausible dashboard](https://plausible.io/plausible.io?f=is,source,chatgpt.com&period=custom&keybindHint=C&from=2025-07-21&to=2025-08-26&comparison=previous_period) for the period starting 21 July, compared to the previous period, filtered for ChatGPT-referred traffic.

Here are the observations:

* Visits down by 29% ↘ (negative signal)
* Views per visit up by 11% (positive signal)
* Bounce rate down by 3% (positive signal)
* Visit duration up by 16% (positive signal)

Even though the traffic has definitely gone down for us by significant margins, the engagement rate has improved. So I checked if the goal conversions from ChatGPT-referred traffic was up too and the conversion rates are all improved, even though the absolute conversions are expectedly reduced.

## What does this mean?

Let’s join the dots.

* ChatGPT models started favouring higher quality sources for providing answers in its chats.
* Citations and direct referral traffic went down
* But engagement on the traffic that did come was higher than before.
* The goal conversions reduced which reflected the declined traffic but again, the percentage of goal conversions on the traffic that did visit our site was higher.

While we have only analyzed our own dashboard, the fact that our engagement rate still improved when the traffic declined is directly related to the fact that ChatGPT is sending more quality traffic as compared to before and this is all because of the improvement in the quality of answers that they provide, citing more reliable sources of the internet.

Another thing that supports this theory is we’re organically mentioned on platforms like Reddit, Wikipedia, and similar, since the beginning of Plausible.

In a nutshell, the quality of answers and citations by ChatGPT models is improving for end-users and only quality, people-first content can still survive.

## So what to do?

Some straightforward solutions will suggest you to do “Reddit growth hacking” or get more Wikipedia mentions or get more and more backlinks from the web.

But we’ve never been the ones to do any sort of citations or growth hacking, neither do I believe that such tactics can survive the next AI update (as it will only get better and better at weeding out content written for making you click *sign up* and not for providing original value).

So here’s our two cents:

### Shift from conversion-first to answer-first content

Think for a second, how ChatGPT conversations are. Regular people, natural language, real queries, real solutions. So if your content still sounds like corporate lingo or doesn’t answer real questions or resonates with real people, you stand a high risk of being left behind.

Another thing to do is manage expectations. AI chats are now being optimized to answer as much as possible within the chat itself, which is bound to affect referrals. Which brings me to the next point. 

### Build a brand and community

While the traffic from SEO, AI, ads – all continue to decline, the one reliable thing that can save your boat is your brand. Brand will give you identity, authority, credibility. That’s unbeatable and if it resonates with the right people, it’ll also be shared by folks on Reddit (and similar communities for instance), and hence cited by ChatGPT and eventually also improve other AI channels as well.

The same goes for your unique community and evangelists so you can minimize dependence on third-party referrals. It could mean more relatable and consistent social media content for you, newsletter subscriptions, or Discord/Slack/LinkedIn/WhatsApp communities, etc.

### Refresh your content

One attribute of Reddit is that it offers fresh content because the conversations are always flowing, 24*7. It could be the latest software updates, the next big trend in fashion, or car reviews –– almost anything you can possibly think of.

Keeping your content up-to-date would also be a good idea.

### Write original content

It can be thought leadership, your unique opinions, original research studies relevant to your industry or useful to your customers –– anything that basically is something unique to your brand.

Such content cannot be duplicated and is instead cited across different content pieces, AI chats, and of course communities like Reddit.
