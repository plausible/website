Europe has been building world-class digital tools for years. A major advantage is that many of these tools prioritize privacy and open-source development by default.

[M﻿illions have been exploring European alternatives](https://plausible.io/blog/european-alternatives-trends-privacy-tech), especially since last year. If you’re looking for alternatives to mainstream big tech services, here’s a handpicked list of high-quality European alternatives for your business.

1. Ordered list
   {:toc}

## Criteria for choosing these tools

We selected these tools based on:

* Built in the EU – Companies headquartered in a European country.
* Hosted in the EU – Ensuring your data doesn’t leave the European borders and stays compliant with European privacy laws.
* GDPR-compliance –  Tools that align with European data protection laws.
* High quality – Competitive with mainstream solutions.
* Privacy-focused – Respecting user data and following GDPR regulations.

**Note**: This list is based on information available in January 2026. If a tool is listed as GDPR-compliant, it is based on the vendor’s own claims. Always verify compliance for your specific needs. 

## Privacy-friendly European B2B tools (A-Z)

### BunnyCDN (Cloudflare alternative)

BunnyCDN is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) designed to enhance website performance by caching and delivering content through a global network of servers.

They also include features like image optimization, video delivery, and edge storage.

### Hetzner (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean alternative)

Hetzner is a German infrastructure provider offering dedicated servers, cloud instances, and storage. Hetzner operates data centers in Germany and Finland, with optional server locations in the United States and Singapore. When you choose an EU location, all customer account data and server data remain within the EU. 

If you choose a non-EU location, only the data stored on that server is processed outside the EU, while customer account data remains under the EU-based Hetzner entity and GDPR safeguards.

Offering non-EU locations is common for infrastructure providers to support global customers. Hetzner remains a reliable EU-based alternative because it is headquartered in Germany, operates under EU law, and allows customers to keep all data entirely within the EU.

Official Hetzner documents also note that the company does not operate its own data center parks outside Europe; in the US and Singapore they use colocation space but remain contractually based in Germany.

**Hosted in:** Germany and Finland, more context explained above

**GDPR compliant?** Yes

At Plausible, we also use Hetzner ourselves. All the data is hosted on servers owned by Hetzner in Germany, and the data never leaves the EU.
