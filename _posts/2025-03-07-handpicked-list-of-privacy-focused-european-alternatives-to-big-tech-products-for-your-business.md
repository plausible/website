Europe has been building world-class digital tools for years. A major advantage is that many of these tools prioritize privacy and open-source development by default.

If you’re looking for alternatives to mainstream big tech services, here’s a handpicked list of high-quality European alternatives for your business.

1. Ordered list
{:toc}

## Criteria for choosing these tools

We selected these tools based on:

* Built in the EU – Companies headquartered in a European country.
* Hosted in the EU – Ensuring your data doesn’t leave the European borders and stays compliant with European privacy laws.
* GDPR-compliance –  Tools that align with European data protection laws.
* High quality – Competitive with mainstream solutions.
* Privacy-focused – Respecting user data and following GDPR regulations.

**Note**: This list is based on information available in March 2025. If a tool is listed as GDPR-compliant, it is based on the vendor’s own claims. Always verify compliance for your specific needs.
