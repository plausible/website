---
I﻿f you have downloadable files on your website, such as PDFs, eBooks, apps, brochure, etc., and are curious about how they are performing, i.e. which files were downloaded, from where on your website, by which audience, etc., then it can be easily done using analytics tools like Google Analytics or a privacy-friendly alt. like Plausible.

F﻿irst, let's see what is a file download and why does it matter to track them. You can skip to the sections below if you're only interested in seeing how to track file downloads on your site.

## What is a file download?

A downloadable file on a website can be any of the following:

* A software or app download, if your product has an app version. For eg. Figma.
* An eBook or whitepaper download, if you have helpful content to share with your audience.
* A spreadsheet download, if you have a useful template to share with your audience. For eg. a product implementation checklist.
* A sales deck, or brochure, to help promote sales or your product’s features.
* An audio, video, or PDF download, that could be anything from a song download to a research paper download.
* Anything else.

## How to track file downloads on your website w﻿ith Google Analytics 4?

You have two options to track file downloads in Google Analytics 4, as outlined below. Once done, you can find your file download events in your "Events" report or create a custom report from scratch as you wish.

### By enabling Enhanced Measurements

Open your GA4 account, go to admin > data collection and modification > data streams. Choose the data stream you want to update.

In the Enhanced measurement section, toggle the switch to On to activate all tracking options. This includes the "file downloads" tracking too.

I﻿n case you want customize individual measurement options, click the gear icon and select just the tracking options you want to keep.

If you're using the Google tag on your site, ensure each event type is enabled for automatic tracking. By default, all events are turned on.

Now, when someone clicks a link on your website that points to a common file type (see list), Google Analytics can automatically track it as a file download event (*file_download*).

* document
* text
* executable
* presentation
* compressed file
* video
* audio

**T﻿wo shortcomings of this method are:** 

* If the URL containing your file download is longer than 100 characters, the end gets cut off—which often includes the file name or extension.
* You cannot customize the list of supported file extensions, so you are limited to: *.pdf, .xls, .xlsx, .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .csv, .exe, .key, .pps, .ppt, .pptx, .7z, .pkg, .rar, .gz, .zip, .avi, .mov, .mp4, .mpe, .mpeg, .wmv, .mid, .midi, .mp3, .wav, .wma.*

I﻿f you want to overcome these shortcomings, your other option is to do a custom setup:

### With Google Tag Manager

H﻿ere's an overview of what you'd need to do: 

1. Create a variable to get the file name from the clicked URL\
   *(e.g., extract `guide.docx` from `https://yourdomain.com/resources/guide.docx`).*
2. Optionally, create another variable to get the file extension\
   *(e.g., extract `docx`).*
3. Set up a link click trigger that detects specific file types (e.g., `.mp3`, `.zip`, `.docx`).
4. Create a GA4 event tag, then test your setup using GTM's preview mode and Debugview.
5. D﻿isable file download tracking as an enhanced measurement.

The link m﻿ust include a visible file extension, like `.docx`, `.mp3`, or `.`

T﻿his is a complicated and lengthy process, may require access to technical resources or a GA/GTM agency and the chances of errors are high.

## P﻿roblems with tracking file downloads with GA4

W﻿hile the flexible method using Google Tag Manager is complicated, even if you use the Enhanced Measurement, you'll be prone to the following issues: 

* Y﻿ou will end up missing some file downloads data as Google Analytics script is widely blocked by various internet users using ad blockers, privacy-friendly browsers. This can also happen when your cookie consent banner is declined by someone. Ultimately leading to [missing stats](https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/inaccurate-google-analytics-traffic-sources/) and misleading insights.
* B﻿ots and spam traffic can skew your file download data as GA4's bot filtering mechanisms are not great. In a [controlled experiment](https://plausible.io/blog/testing-bot-traffic-filtering-google-analytics), we saw first-hand how GA4 allowed bots to show as real users in the dashboard. If such non-human visits trigger your file downloads, your stats will simply be misleading.



## How to track file downloads on your website w﻿ith Plausible Analytics?

If you are using Plausible, adding the code snippet for [tracking file downloads](https://plausible.io/docs/file-downloads-tracking) to the Plausible integration script is optional. Once done, it starts capturing file download events each time a link is clicked containing a file extension.

All types of file extensions can be tracked with Plausible, either by default or by specification. On the Plausible dashboard, you will be able to see:

* The number of total file download clicks
* The number of unique file download clicks
* The conversion rate
* Top referral sources that lead to clicks
* [Top pages](https://plausible.io/blog/analyzing-landing-pages) that drive the clicks
* Countries, regions and cities that click on file download
* Devices (screen size, browser, OS) that click on file download

Most web analytics tools, including Plausible, track a file download as a link click including a specific extension. Plausible tracks the following: `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.csv`, `.exe`, `.key`, `.pps`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.7z`, `.pkg`, `.rar`, `.gz`, `.zip`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.wmv`, `.midi`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.wma`, `.dmg`, and other custom extensions.

If you don’t have file downloads to track, you can keep the original script intact, which is effective and efficient. This helps us keep our main tracking script lightweight and not deteriorate page load speeds and visitor experience.

Google Analytics 4, on the other hand, has a bloated tracking script as it comes with automatic file downloads tracking as part of its Enhanced Measurements. A compressed Google Analytics integration script is much larger than [Plausible’s lightweight script](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics).

## Why track file downloads?

Tracking how your downloadable files are performing can help you learn about…

### What’s in demand

If your resource comes as a downloadable feature extension (like a font pack for a design software), an educational piece (like a customer success guide), or a complementary tool (like an analytics plugin), tracking the downloads of a resource helps understand if it’s something that’s in demand with your audience.

### How well positioned your resource is

With learning about what’s in demand, comes the understanding of how well your resource fulfills it. With this understanding, you can improve both the content quality and its distribution ways.

### Your audience

A good look at your file download patterns also reveals some insights about your audience. For eg. Do they enjoy lengthy reads with an eBook? Maybe the download numbers are not encouraging, and it might be beneficial to start repurposing your content into infographics.

Moreover, analyzing download data alongside other metrics like demographics and behavior can help you segment your audience better. You can identify specific audience segments that are interested in particular forms and types of content and tailor your marketing accordingly.

### Your campaigns

If your downloadable resources are a part of a marketing campaign or a [funnel](https://plausible.io/blog/funnels-conversion-optimization), tracking them also gives a good indicator about the health of the campaign. By quantifying downloads and comparing them to costs, you can calculate the campaign's ROI, opening up opportunities for refining strategy and assigning resources.

### Lead generation

If your downloadable file is gated behind a contact form, tracking its downloads can help understand which content drives the most form submissions. In turn, you can measure the effectiveness of your lead generation efforts.

Staying in sight of this information reveals how valuable a resource is to your audience, how effective is your distribution strategy and what improvements can be made to these two.

It is therefore a direct reflection of the degree of value a business or marketing is generating for its audience, and could offer deeper analysis into a business’ core strategy itself. Let’s see what a file download is, and how to keep in touch to improve your marketing and distribution strategies.

## How to optimize for file downloads?

### Optimize content quality

After learning what works well with your audience, focus on enhancing the quality of your high-performing resources by updating them with the latest information, improving their design, or adding more value through additional features or insights.

Similarly, either weed out the less effective ones or experiment with a different kind of improvement.

### Optimize landing pages

Ensure that the landing pages hosting your downloadable content are optimized for user-friendliness, and hence conversions.

Some good practices are to use clear and compelling copy and calls-to-action (CTAs), making the download process straightforward, and highlighting the benefits of the resource. Also, A/B/C... test different page elements to see which variations drive more downloads.

### Optimize distribution channels

Use the insights from your analytics to identify the most effective distribution channels, while segmenting the audience.

Figure out which kinds of audiences (and whether they are your ideal customers) come from email marketing, social media, or your blog, and double down efforts on the channels that drive the most traffic and conversions.

### Monitor and adjust

Keep an eye on metrics such as download counts, conversion rates, and referral sources to identify emerging patterns. Adjust by promoting, updating, or withdrawing resources as needed.
