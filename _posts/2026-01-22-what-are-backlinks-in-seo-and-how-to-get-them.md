Backlinks are when another website (another domain) links back to you.

If any blogger, company site, or basically any site includes a clickable link to your site, that is a backlink, also known as an “inbound link.” For eg., We have a backlink from Wikipedia, and you can check out the image above to see what it looks like.👆

Think of it like a whole network of webpages linking to a few of each other which makes navigating the web easier. It also helps in writing content itself as you can cite your resources, add references, etc., by linking to the relevant webpage.
