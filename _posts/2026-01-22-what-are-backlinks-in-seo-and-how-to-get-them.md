Backlinks are when another website (another domain) links back to you.

If any blogger, company site, or basically any site includes a clickable link to your site, that is a backlink, also known as an “inbound link.” For eg., We have a backlink from Wikipedia, and you can check out the image above to see what it looks like.👆

Think of it like a whole network of webpages linking to a few of each other which makes navigating the web easier. It also helps in writing content itself as you can cite your resources, add references, etc., by linking to the relevant webpage.

## Why are backlinks important? 

In SEO terms, backlinks act as **signals of trust** and authority to search engines like Google. When other websites link to your site, it essentially means that “*This content is useful and worth referencing*,” and search engines take that as a positive signal. In turn, they rank you higher on the SERPs and you ideally get more traffic.

*A little backstory*…Google’s algorithm was originally built around this idea. Pages that received more links naturally tended to be more helpful, so Google began using backlinks as a core ranking factor. They themselves have [accepted](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/ranking-results/) that.

So what then? If you get a few sites to link back to you, you’ll start enjoying high rankings in Google and get a ton of organic traffic? It’s not that simple.

## Good vs okay backlinks

Think of backlinks like recommendations from around the internet. Here’s what separates a good and rather useful backlink from the not so good ones:

### They come from reputed domains

A link from a high quality, relevant website is far more valuable than dozens of links from low quality or spammy sites.

A “quality” website in this case is trustworthy, authoritative, and relevant to your industry. For example, a link from a major news site or a reputed industry blog in your field would be more useful than a link from an unknown or poorly maintained website.

#### What does “authority” mean in SEO?

When we say “authority” in SEO, it means how trustworthy and credible a website appears to search engines, based on how strong a website’s backlink profile is compared to others.

Google itself does not publish a specific “authority” score. But major SEO tools like Moz, Ahrefs, and Semrush have created their own metrics to estimate a site’s authority which gives people a point of reference and something to work off of. The metrics are called:

* Domain Authority (DA) in Moz
* Domain Rating (DR) in Ahrefs
* Authority Score in Semrush

Higher the score, better the authority. Every strong backlink you earn helps build your site’s overall authority, making it easier for your future content to rank as well.

### They are contextually placed

Search engines also look at context. A backlink placed naturally within a helpful article is more valuable than one placed randomly in, say, a comment section. Google is good at understanding (especially now, after years of algorithm evolution) whether a link was earned because of great content or created purely to manipulate rankings.

### The anchor text is helpful

The anchor text is the clickable text used in a hyperlink. Search engines, and of course readers, use anchor text to understand what the linked page is about.

A good backlink uses natural, descriptive anchor text that fits the context of the article. For example, if your site or webpage is about email marketing, a helpful backlink might look like: “Learn more about **email deliverability best practices** here.”

So, “email deliverability best practices” tells Google what the linked page covers (and basically helps reinforce the relevance of your page for that topic).

On the other hand, low quality backlinks often use vague or spammy anchor text like: “Click here” or “learn more” or “this.”

### They are “dofollow” links

A [“dofollow” link](https://www.semrush.com/blog/dofollow-link/) (*I just backlinked to Semrush for dofollow links btw, this is backlinking live in action*) allows search engines to follow the link and pass authority from the linking site to yours.

Some links are categorically marked as “nofollow,” which tells search engines not to pass ranking credit. They can still bring you traffic and visibility, but technically speaking: dofollow links are the ones that directly strengthen your SEO.

For example, a normal dofollow link looks like this in HTML:

`<a href="https://example.com">SEO tools</a>`

A nofollow link looks like this:

`<a href="https://example.com" rel="nofollow">SEO tools</a>`

Wikipedia is a well known example of this. All external links from Wikipedia use the `rel="nofollow"` attribute.

Even though such links can send traffic and add credibility with readers, it does not directly pass SEO authority in the same way a dofollow link does – technically speaking.

### They send real referral traffic
