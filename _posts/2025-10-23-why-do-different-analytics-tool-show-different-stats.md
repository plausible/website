If you’re comparing the data that you see in your Plausible dashboard with another tool you use like Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, an email provider, Facebook ads, etc., seeing some differences is almost guaranteed.

That can lead to questions like: *Which tool is “right”? What do the differences mean? Should I trust one over the other? Is there a bug? Is my setup correct?*

I﻿n this blog post, we will explain why that happens — how things like browser blocking, cookie-consent banners, bot traffic, different definitions of m﻿etrics, how tags are installed, and more can lead to sizable differences. 

The goal isn’t to declare one tool “right” and the others “wrong,” but to help you interpret the numbers and use them wisely.

## What makes analytics numbers differ?

Here are the main factors — across all categories of tools — that lead to discrepancies:

### Cookie consent and privacy settings

Many tools rely on cookies or identifiers that require visitor consent under GDPR/CCPA. For example, if visitors decline tracking, a tool like GA4 may not count them. Plausible, by contrast, is designed to not rely on cookies and is privacy-friendly by default.

That difference alone can mean large gaps, especially for audiences in regions with strict consent laws.

### Script blocking by browsers & extensions

Ad-blockers, privacy browsers (Safari, Brave, Firefox) and other browser-privacy settings often block popular analytics scripts (e.g., Google’s). Since Plausible is smaller, more lightweight and privacy-friendly, it tends to be blocked less often.

When one tool is blocked a lot and another isn’t, the numbers diverge.

### Tracking methodology & definitions

Different tools measure different things, and may define “users,” “sessions,” “visits,” “clicks” differently.

For eg., Email platforms count every click on a tracked email link, ad platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc) count when someone clicks an ad — even if they close the page before it loads. But a web analytics tool only counts visits where the page loads and the script runs successfully.

Result: Click numbers from email or ad tools will almost always be higher than visits in your web analytic dashboard.

### Bots, crawlers and non-human traffic

Some tools (like Plausible) filter known bots/crawlers more aggressively; others include more of them (or count them as visits). Also, server-side logs or hosting dashboards count many requests from bots which analytics tools may ignore.

Thus, if one tool filters bots more strictly than another, you’ll see differences.

### Data sampling, modeling or estimated data

Some analytics platforms (especially large ones) apply data modeling or estimates when full data isn’t available (due to blocking, consent denied, etc.). Others only show what they “actually measured.” If one tool shows measured + modeled data and another shows measured only, the numbers naturally differ.

For eg, GA4 advertises modeling to fill gaps where tracking is difficult.

### Implementation / integration issues on your site

Sometimes the difference comes down to how the tracking is set up: script placed in the wrong place, tag fired too late or not at all, duplicate tags, incorrect redirects, etc. Small differences in setup affect whether a tool “sees” the visit or not.

### Attribution, scope and metric definition differences

* Does a tool count a “click” or a “page view” or a “session”?
* Does a user navigating to a site via email link count in the same way as via organic search?
* Are campaign parameters (UTMs) used differently?
* Does a bounce count differently in one tool vs another?

Because each tool’s definitions vary, you’re comparing apples and oranges unless you align them carefully.

### Different scopes (visits vs clicks vs impressions)

Finally, some tools track impressions (how many times something was shown), some track clicks, some track page loads or sessions. If you compare an email-tool click count with a website-analytics visit count, you’ll almost always see mismatch — and that’s expected.

T﻿hese points alone must have painted a picture about why data differences occur. If you're comparing a specific tool to Plausible, feel free to go through our metrics' [definitions](https://plausible.io/docs/metrics-definitions), [ways of handling data](https://plausible.io/data-policy), or our [documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/) to help understand the differences deeply.

Y﻿ou can also find the specific category of comparison down below to help understand the differences.

## Category 1: Comparing Plausible data with other web analytics tools

Web analytics tools like GA4, Matomo, Plausible, Cloudflare, etc., require you to embed a script on your website which runs in the visitor’s browser, then reports data back to the respective dashboard.

While all web analytics tools operate similarly in principle, and essentially track same things, differences in design mean they report different numbers.

**How they differ vs Plausible:**

* Script size & blocking: Some tools use large scripts and may be blocked more frequently. Plausible is intentionally lightweight and designed for minimal blocking.
* Tracking identifiers: Some use cookies, localStorage, unique user IDs, device fingerprinting; Plausible hashes IP + User-Agent + domain with a daily salt, resetting every 24 hours so no persistent user ID is stored.
* Privacy default: Plausible is built with “privacy by default” in mind. Other tools may collect more granular data (for example user-id, device, cross-device, etc) which may also affect blocking/consent.
* Session definition: Different tools define session boundaries differently; e.g., when a session ends, when new session starts, how returning visitors are counted.
* Bot filtering: Each tool has its own logic/lists for what is a bot vs human visit.
* Data modeling or sampling: Some tools may sample large datasets or apply modeling; Plausible does not sample and shows only what was actually captured.

### GA4 vs Plausible

**How GA4 works**\
GA4 uses an event-based tracking model, with cookies or user-ids identifying users/sessions, and offers extensive features for attribution, cross-device tracking, integrations with other Google products. GA4 also may apply data modeling or estimated data in certain reports when full data isn’t available.

**How Plausible works**\
Plausible’s public documentation states they use a small script, no cookies, no personal identifiers, and focus on privacy and speed. ([Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Why you’ll often see fewer visits in Plausible (or different numbers):

* GA4 script may be more widely blocked, especially by ad-blockers, while Plausible may still count visits when GA4 doesn’t.
* GA4 may rely on consent if implemented that way—if you’ve set GA4 to wait for consent then visits without consent aren’t counted; Plausible may count them (depending on your setup).
* GA4 in some cases uses estimations or modeling in certain reports; Plausible shows only what was measured.
* GA4 may merge devices/users under the same user-id; Plausible resets daily so returning visitors appear as new if they change device or browser.
