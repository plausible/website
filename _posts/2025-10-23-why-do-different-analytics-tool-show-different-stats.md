If you’re comparing the data that you see in your Plausible dashboard with another tool you use like Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, an email provider, Facebook ads, etc., seeing some differences is almost guaranteed.

That can lead to questions like: *Which tool is “right”? What do the differences mean? Should I trust one over the other? Is there a bug? Is my setup correct?*

This blog post is here to help explain why that happens — things like browser blocking, cookie-consent banners, bot traffic, different definitions of m﻿etrics, how tags are installed, and more. Understanding these differences isn’t about finding “which number is right” but learning what each number actually means. 

With that in mind, you’ll be better equipped to interpret your data — both in Plausible and in your other tools — and feel confident in the insights you’re drawing.

## What makes analytics numbers differ?

Here are the main factors — across all categories of tools — that lead to discrepancies:

### Cookie consent and privacy settings

Many tools rely on cookies or identifiers that require visitor consent under GDPR/CCPA. For example, if visitors decline tracking, a tool may not count them. Plausible, by contrast, is designed to not rely on cookies and is privacy-friendly by default.

That difference alone can mean large gaps, especially for audiences in regions with strict consent laws.

### Script blocking by browsers & extensions

Ad-blockers, privacy browsers (Safari, Brave, Firefox) and other browser-privacy settings often block popular analytics scripts (e.g., Google’s). Since Plausible is smaller, more lightweight and privacy-friendly, it tends to be blocked less often.

When one tool is blocked a lot and another isn’t, the numbers diverge.

### Tracking methodology & definitions

Different tools measure different things, and may define “users,” “sessions,” “visits,” “clicks” differently.

For eg., Email platforms count every click on a tracked email link, ad platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc) count when someone clicks an ad — even if they close the page before it loads. But a web analytics tool like Plausible only counts visits where the page loads and the script runs successfully.

Result: Click numbers from email or ad tools will almost always be higher than visits in your Plausible dashboard.

### Bots, crawlers and non-human traffic

Some tools will filter known bots/crawlers more aggressively; others will include more of them (or count them as visits). Also, server-side logs or hosting dashboards count many requests from bots which analytics tools may ignore.\
Thus, if one tool filters bots more strictly than another, you’ll see differences.

### Data sampling, modeling or estimated data

Some analytics platforms (especially large ones) apply data modeling or estimates when full raw data isn’t available (due to blocking, consent denied, etc.). Others only show what they “actually measured.” If one tool shows measured + modeled data and another shows measured only, the numbers naturally differ.\
For example, GA4 advertises modeling to fill gaps where tracking is difficult.\
(Strictness of documentation varies.)

### Implementation / integration issues on your site

Sometimes the difference comes down to how the tracking is set up: script placed in the wrong place, tag fired too late or not at all, duplicate tags, incorrect redirect chains, multiple analytics libraries conflicting.\
Small differences in setup affect whether a tool “sees” the visit or not.

### Attribution, scope and metric definition differences

* Does a tool count a “click” or a “page view” or a “session”?
* Does a user navigating to a site via email link count in the same way as via organic search?
* Are campaign parameters (UTMs) used differently?
* Does a bounce count differently in one tool vs another?\
  Because each tool’s definitions vary, you’re comparing apples and oranges unless you align them carefully.

### Different scopes (visits vs clicks vs impressions)

Finally, some tools track impressions (how many times something was shown), some track clicks, some track page loads or sessions. If you compare an email-tool click count with a website-analytics visit count, you’ll almost always see mismatch — and that’s expected.

## Category 1: Other web analytics tools (script on site)

These are tools that require you to embed a script on your website which runs in the visitor’s browser, then reports data back. Examples: GA4, Matomo, Fathom Analytics, Simple Analytics, Umami.

They operate similarly to Plausible in principle — embedded script, page-views/events, etc — but differences in design mean they report different numbers.
