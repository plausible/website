When you open your Plausible dashboard, one of the key reports you see is the “Top Pages” report. It shows you at a glance, which of your landing pages received the most visits for the time period selected.

This helps you understand which content or features are drawing in the most traffic, allowing you to gauge interest in specific products, blog posts, pricing pages, or other important sections.

You can also club this information with other analytics like top sources to understand  where your traffic is coming from and which channels (e.g., search engines, social media, or referrals) are driving visitors to specific pages. 

By doing this, you can get a clearer picture of how effective each traffic source is in bringing users to your high-performing pages, and adjust your marketing or content strategy to focus on the channels that contribute the most value.

Here’s what the report offers and how to use it effectively:

## How to use the Pages report?

If you don’t have an active Plausible account, you can open our [live demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io) in a new tab to play around with the Pages report and the dashboard.

### Top, Entry and Exit pages

The Pages report is not only limited to the Top Pages, but you can switch among the following three types of reports:

1. Top Pages – to analyze the pages with the most visitors. 
2. Entry Pages – to analyze the pages where visitors first land on your site.
3. Exit Pages – to analyze the pages where visitors leave your site.

These reports effectively help you pinpoint which pages are drawing in visitors initially, holding their attention, and acting as exit points.

For eg., If you look at our live demo, the top most entries for all the three reports are the same (“/:dashboard,” “/sites”, etc.), suggesting that maximum Plausible visitors enter, stay and exit from their Plausible accounts itself, indicating maximum engagement with the core product. 

It can also be used as an insight, because if we were to announce an urgent product update tomorrow, we know an in-app notification may be the best place to do so.

Secondly, you can click the “Details” link to get the full list of the types of pages in question. The associated metrics differ. You can also sort your reports by clicking on any metric.

For instance, sorting by visitors can help you see which pages attract the most visits, while sorting by time on page shows you where visitors spend the most time.

“Top Pages” displays the Visitors, Pageviews, Bounce Rate, and Time on Page. “Entry Pages” displays the Visitors, Total Entrances, and Visit Duration. “Exit pages” displays the Visitors, Total Exits, and Exit Rate.

P.S. You can check out the [definitions](https://plausible.io/docs/metrics-definitions) of such metrics here.

### Filter and segment entries

If you click on any entry in any of the three kinds of reports, the entire dashboard gets filtered by it and displays stats associated with that landing page only.

For eg., Our live demo shows that during the past 30 days, ignoring the first few product-specific pages, our landing page on open-source web analytics brought us 1.5k visitors.
