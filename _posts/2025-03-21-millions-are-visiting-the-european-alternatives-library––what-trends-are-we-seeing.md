‚òùÔ∏èThat‚Äôs a screenshot from the publicly open Plausible Analytics dashboard of the European Alternatives [website](https://european-alternatives.eu/), featuring independent, privacy-friendly digital tools.

With almost 2M visitors, 2.3M total visits, and 8.5M pageviews, this library is no longer a niche project‚Äîit‚Äôs the go-to destination for users looking for independent, privacy-friendly tools. Over 1 million of the ~2 million all-time visitors came in 2025 alone‚Äîand we‚Äôre only in March.

Let‚Äôs use the analytics [dashboard](https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu) to see what trends are emerging and what is the demand looking like for EU-built, privacy-friendly tech.

## 1100% surge in 2025 traffic

If we filter the dashboard by ‚ÄúYear to date‚Äù period, i.e. 2025 so far, we see there have been 1.3 million visitors to the website, with a surge of 1.1K%.¬†

![1100% surge in 2025 traffic](/uploads/2025-stats-for-eu-alternatives.png "1100% surge in 2025 traffic")

Another interesting number is the ‚Äútime on page,‚Äù which is 2m47s spent on average. This goes on to show that people are interested and engaging well with the library.

## Reddit surpasses Google, while privacy-friendly search engines gain traction

Look at the Top Sources report for 2025 so far:

![top-sources-2025-eu-alternatives](/uploads/top-sources-2025-eu-alternatives.png "top-sources-2025-eu-alternatives")

Google is typically the dominant search driver for most websites‚Äîbut not here. Reddit ranks as the second-largest traffic source, bringing in 311K visitors‚Äîsignificantly more than Google (193K). This isn‚Äôt a regular thing we see with sites.

This suggests that people aren‚Äôt just searching for alternatives but are actively discussing and recommending them in forums, subreddits, and privacy-conscious communities.

But here‚Äôs another interesting insight: Privacy-friendly search engines are also key traffic sources:

* DuckDuckGo: 33.8K visitors
* Ecosia: 13.5K visitors
* Qwant: 10.8K visitors

This says something about the increasing preference for privacy-friendly tools, i.e., more people are actively using privacy-friendly search engines to discover other privacy-friendly alternatives.

## Top 5 categories: What are people looking for?

A quick look at the "Top Pages" report tells us about the most popular top 5 categories:

\- Email providers

\- Search Engines

\- Cloud Computing Platforms

\- Navigation Apps

\- Web Analytics Services

Upon expanding the report, we can take a deeper look at the most popular categories in terms of unique visitors, while comparing the engagement metrics.

**B2B categories win?**

While categories like email providers, search engines, and navigation apps attract a large B2C audience, B2B categories are more diverse and consistently rank high.¬†

Businesses are actively seeking privacy-friendly analytics, hosting, and infrastructure alternatives, driving growth in EU-built tools.

## Not just a European trend‚Äîdemand goes beyond the EU borders

Looking at the [all-time Countries report](https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?period=all&keybindHint=A&comparison=off&match_day_of_week=true): European countries make up the bulk of visitors (as expected), but the United States ranks fourth, sending over 100K visitors to the site!¬†

Even Canada and India make an appearance in the top 25, contributing decent amounts of visitors to the site.

If you scroll all the way down, or simply look at the ‚ÄúMap view,‚Äù there‚Äôs hardly any part of the globe that‚Äôs not participating in the shift towards privacy-focused digital tools.

![map-view](/uploads/map-view.png "map-view")

Privacy-conscious users are everywhere.

## Which European tools are winning?¬†

The dashboard has an [Outbound link click goal](https://plausible.io/docs/outbound-link-click-tracking) configured, which is useful in understanding which listed tools eventually attract real visitors. Once we filter the dashboard by this goal (see it [here](https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?f=is,goal,Outbound%20Link:%20Click&period=all&keybindHint=A&comparison=off&match_day_of_week=true)), we can see which URLs were clicked.

From these results, these are the top 10 tools receiving traffic from the EU alternatives website:¬†

1. [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/) (email provider)
2. [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail) (email provider)
3. [Soverin](https://soverin.com/) (email provider)
4. [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) (search engine)
5. [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/) (search engine)
6. [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en) (email provider)
7. [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) (search engine)
8. [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) (cloud provider)
9. [Startmail](https://www.startmail.com/) (email provider)
10. [Good search](https://good-search.org/en/) (search engine)

And if we look at the all-time data, there‚Äôs a whopping 1.2M total outbound clicks from the website to such tools, that‚Äôs more than half of the total all-time visits to the library.

And conversions aren‚Äôt just from Europe‚Äîthe U.S. audience alone has a 16.8% conversion rate (check [here](https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?f=is,goal,Outbound%20Link:%20Click&f=is,country,US&l=US,United%20States&period=all&keybindHint=A&comparison=off&match_day_of_week=true))!

## Privacy-friendly web analytics is on the rise

We started Plausible Analytics six years ago as a privacy-first, [GDPR-compliant](https://plausible.io/data-policy), [cookieless](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-cookies) and muuuch [easier-to-use](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics) alternative to Google Analytics.

So, we took a look at how our category is doing:

* 5th most popular category in the library
* 9th most visited page overall
* More than a 2,700% increase in unique visitors in 2025

The demand for privacy-friendly web analytics is booming. If you‚Äôre looking for an alternative, check out our [privacy-first approach](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).
