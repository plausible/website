☝️That’s a screenshot from the publicly open Plausible Analytics dashboard of the European Alternatives [website](https://european-alternatives.eu/), featuring independent, privacy-friendly digital tools.

With almost 2M visitors, 2.3M total visits, and 8.5M pageviews, this library is no longer a niche project—it’s the go-to destination for users looking for independent, privacy-friendly tools. Over 1 million of the ~2 million all-time visitors came in 2025 alone—and we’re only in March.

Let’s use the analytics [dashboard](https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu) to see what trends are emerging and what is the demand looking like for EU-built, privacy-friendly tech.

## 1100% surge in 2025 traffic

If we filter the dashboard by “Year to date” period, i.e. 2025 so far, we see there have been 1.3 million visitors to the website, with a surge of 1.1K%.
