If you are noticing your website traffic is down, the first thing to do is investigate the reasons. Don’t panic, you were probably hit by a Google’s core update, something maybe off on the technical side, the site may be responding to a new trend, or you may simply need to write more/better content.

Interestingly, at the time of writing this post, we are also noticing a drop in our website traffic for the last 30 days. This compelled me to investigate on our end too and opened the perfect opportunity to cover this topic.

To do this, you need a web analytics tool, and if the situation demands, access to your SEO tool (or other similar free alternatives) and Google webmaster tools.

By taking you through the things you can do on such tools and taking our own investigation as an example, we will demonstrate how to diagnose the issues causing your website’s traffic to decline.
