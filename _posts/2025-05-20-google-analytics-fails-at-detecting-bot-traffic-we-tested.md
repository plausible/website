A good chunk of the traffic you see in Google Analytics could be bots (or non-human to be more precise). We tested by simulating non-human traffic to a test site. Google Analytics recorded it as real traffic. Plausible Analytics rejected it all.

Bots now account for more than half of all internet traffic ([src](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/bots-now-account-for-over-half-of-all-internet-traffic)) and it is very likely that your website too gets bot traffic every now and then.

Bots, scrapers, headless browsers ‚Äî they can all hit your site and trigger tracking scripts. If your analytics tool counts that traffic as human, your data becomes misleading. You might think you're getting more visits than you actually are.

You don‚Äôt want to be seeing ‚Äúnon-real‚Äù traffic in your analytics dashboard as such traffic could inflate your pageviews, distort your engagement metrics, conversion events and other insights. If the scale is high, it could cause you to make totally misled business decisions, while giving a false sense of performance. Worst, it could lead you to invest in wrong marketing channels.

Usually, it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint on an analytics dashboard whether a particular visit was from a human or a non-human. So how bad is the problem really?


To find out, we ran a controlled experiment: we built a test site, sent only simulated bot traffic to it, and compared what each analytics tool recorded.

## Experiment: Simulating bot traffic to see what analytics tools catch

TL;DR: We wrote some scripts to pose as bot traffic does in reality, and sent such traffic to a test site where both Google Analytics and Plausible Analytics scripts were installed. You can see the results below.

To begin with, we created a dummy site on Vercel using an Astro template and installed the tracking scripts for both Plausible Analytics and Google Analytics on it.

See here:

![analytics-test-site-page-source](/uploads/analytics-test-site-page-source.png "analytics-test-site-page-source")

To simulate bot traffic, we built a [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) (a Node.js library for controlling browsers) script that opened the website in a headless browser and performed specific actions.

The script was used to simulate two kinds of traffic patterns,¬†

1. With a known, non-browser User Agent. In our case, we set the User-Agent to "PostmanRuntime/7.43.4" (clearly non-human), and¬†
2. With the User-Agent set to a real looking browser, randomly selecting from 4 different valid User Agent strings.

> üí° In simpler terms, User-Agent strings are how browsers identify themselves to websites ‚Äî like saying, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Chrome on a Mac.‚Äù Bots or programs can use either a specific User Agent, for instance an API client like Postman will use \`PostmanRuntime\`, while some bots would try to masquerade as a real browser and will use a valid User-Agent.
>
> By testing both obvious bots and sneaky ones pretending to be normal browsers, we could see whether Google Analytics is smart enough to tell real users apart from scripted visits ‚Äî even when they look legit on the surface.

In both cases, we opened multiple browser instances, each of which visited the page. The script was written to scroll a bit to simulate user behaviour in 50% of the visits. And in 30% of the visits, the script would click on a link to navigate to another page.

This script typically took 5-10 seconds on my M1 Macbook Pro to run 10 simultaneous sessions (variables like hardware and network will affect the performance of these runs): clearly a ‚Äúnon-human traffic pattern‚Äù.

To ensure the data is clean and the bot has the best chance to pose as a real human, we ensured a few things:

1. There was a random delay in between actions
2. The window size was a bit different from each other between sessions
3. Ran the script from my local IP, since a data center IP is relatively easy to track.
4. The scripts were run immediately after deploying the website, before the rest of the humans or non-humans on the internet could say ‚Äúhello‚Äù
5. I also blocked Plausible and GA4 explicitly on my visits to the site using content blockers to ensure that my visits are not logged in any form.

The website was hosted on Vercel, allowing us to observe all the requests that were made to the website. This helped us verify our results, ensuring that the data was actually received by the browser. We also ensured that any bot detection and blocking on Vercel was disabled.

You can find the script that automated the browser [here](https://gist.github.com/Hricha-Shandily/8510495f597fc70a8d7d4294c3120878), and the script that was used to run this test in bulk [here](https://gist.github.com/Hricha-Shandily/4c09fac752f3d02994111c0b994aa8b3), in case you wish to replicate the results.

Alright, result time!

### Results

During the first round of simulating non-human traffic, we set the User-Agent to "PostmanRuntime/7.43.4" (clearly non-human).

Google Analytics got fooled:

**15 May 2025, 23:23.**

You can see traffic getting recorded in real time in the screenshot below, with 22 pageviews getting recorded.

This is actually a fairly basic method of identifying non-human traffic but to my surprise, Google Analytics failed at this in the test.

Plausible Analytics recorded none of such traffic and showed beautiful zeroes (I had already blocked my own visit too):

**15 May 2025, 23:23.**

And here‚Äôs the screenshot from Vercel (where the site is hosted), where you can see requests coming from a User-Agent "PostmanRuntime/7.43.4".

Note that I didn‚Äôt actually use Postman, just posed as it using Puppeteer. Postman was selected since it‚Äôs a widely known API testing tool, and any analytics tool should in theory be able to detect and block it.¬†
