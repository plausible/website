If you are trying to measure and analyze the activities on your Shopify store, you can use the in-built Shopify Analytics, and pair/replace it with Google Analytics or simpler, powerful and privacy-friendly alternatives like Plausible Analytics. 

A good combination of these tools can help you effectively monitor store activity, understand visitor behavior, analyze web performance, marketing campaigns, attribute sales, and much more. You can use these insights to boost revenue, optimize your store, marketing initiatives, etc.

So let’s understand what each option can offer so you can make an informed decision.

## Shopify Analytics: the built-in reporting system

The first and foremost is the native reporting system offered by Shopify itself: “Shopify Analytics”. It’s available right in your Shopify account and accessible from the admin side panel.

It gives merchants a quick overview of their store’s performance while the reports help you track your store's activities, understand your customers, analyze sales, finances, etc.

Since it’s native to Shopify, you don’t need to do a manual dashboard or report setup, unless you want a custom dashboard (available only with higher plans).

Standard reporting is available with all the pricing plans. According to Shopify’s [pricing page](https://www.shopify.com/pricing), you can “access 60+ reports to track your store performance or build custom reporting with flexible, real-time analytics.”

Shopify’s analytics includes three main components: an Overview dashboard, detailed reports, and a live view. These are available under “Analytics” from the admin sidebar.

### Types of reporting in Shopify

#### Overview dashboard

This is the first thing you’ll see. An overview of your most important ecommerce metrics like sales, orders, conversion rate, etc. (metrics explained below), at a glance.

It’s a collection of data cards (metrics) with summary numbers and trend graphs. You can customize which metrics appear here but only on the desktop view.

You can select a date range like today, yesterday, last 30 days, etc., while also comparing performance to a previous period or year, showing percentage changes so you can gauge growth or decline. You can click any metric card to dive into a corresponding detailed report.

If you look at the sidebar menu, you can open your “Reports”.

#### Reports

You will find a library of predefined reports, divided by categories like Finances, Acquisition, Behavior, etc.

Each report typically includes a graph and a detailed data table. You can filter and segment these reports to answer specific questions such as viewing sales by a specific product or channel.

The default Shopify reporting categories consist of the following:

**Acquisition reports**: For understanding how many sessions and visitors are acquired during a time period and from which locations and which referring sites. 

**Behavior reports**: For understanding your customers' shopping behavior.

**Customers reports**: This helps understand stuff like customers by location, Returning customers, One-time customers, Customer cohort analysis.

**Finance reports**: This helps understand everything from a finance summary to store credit transactions, liabilities finance report, gift cards, taxes, sales, etc.

**Fraud reports**: Monitor and analyze fraudulent activities, including chargeback rates and high-risk orders, to enhance store security.

**Inventory report**s: Track stock levels, monitor inventory movements, and assess product availability to optimize inventory management.

**Marketing reports**: Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by analyzing metrics like sessions attributed to marketing and sales conversions.

**Order reports**: Gain insights into order trends, fulfillment statuses, and return rates to streamline order processing and customer satisfaction.\
\
**Profit reports**: Assess profitability by examining gross profit margins, cost of goods sold, and net profit across products and sales channels.

**Retail sales reports**: Analyze in-person sales performance, staff contributions, and product sales within retail locations to inform business decisions. ​

**Sales reports**: Review comprehensive sales data, including total sales, sales by product or channel, and average order values, to understand revenue streams.

Each category has multiple reports of its own.

Custom reporting and advanced filtering options are also available but only on higher Shopify plans, but all Shopify stores have access to the core reports.

#### Live View

This offers a real-time visualization of what’s happening in your site right now. It shows the number of current visitors, their locations, actions they are taking, and any live sales or checkouts happening at that moment. It’s particularly useful during peak traffic events like flash sales or product launches.

### Key metrics

You will find a variety of metrics across the overview dashboard and reports. These are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that Shopify tracks for your store.

It’s important to understand what each metric means in Shopify. Here’s a summary of the most important metrics you’ll see:

**Total Sales**: The total revenue your store earned in the selected period, after all adjustments. In Shopify, Total sales is essentially your net sales plus any additional charges like taxes, shipping, and duties. 

It accounts for product sales minus discounts and returns, and then adds things like shipping charges or taxes that customers paid. (On some dashboards, you might see Gross Sales and Net Sales separately – see below – but Total Sales is the bottom-line number.)

**Gross Sales**: This is the value of all items sold at their full price, before any discounts, returns, or other deductions​. It’s essentially your sales if nothing was discounted and no orders were refunded. 

This can be useful to see your store’s potential revenue or the pre-discount demand. For example, if you sold 10 items priced at $50 each, gross sales would be $500 (even if some customers used a coupon or returned items — those adjustments come in below).

**Net Sales**: Net sales are your actual sales revenue after discounts and returns. Shopify calculates Net Sales as Gross Sales – discounts – returns​. 

Importantly, net sales exclude taxes and shipping fees (since those are usually pass-through or additional charges). 

Using the previous example, if gross sales were $500 but one $50 item was returned and another $50 order had a $10 discount, then net sales would be $500 – $50 – $10 = $440.

**Total Orders**: The count of orders placed in the period, across all your sales channels. This counts each order (transaction) once, regardless of how many items were in it. It’s a basic measure of how many purchases were made. 

**Online Store Sessions**: The number of visits to your online store (traffic volume). In Shopify, a “session” is a period of continuous activity by a visitor. If the same person comes back later, that counts as a new session. 

Note that sessions are usually higher than unique visitors, because one person can visit multiple times.

**Conversion Rate**: The percentage of visits that lead to a purchase. Shopify’s conversion rate is typically defined as (# of orders / # of sessions) x 100%. So, a 20% conversion rate means 20 out of every 100 sessions resulted in an order. 

In the Overview dashboard, the conversion rate breakdown card usually also breaks down the conversion funnel by showing the percentage of sessions that added something to cart, the percentage that proceeded to checkout, and the percentage that actually completed a purchase. 

This helps you see where customers might be dropping off.

**Average Order Value (AOV)**: A key sales metric that tells you the average amount each order is worth. It’s calculated as Total sales revenue / Total number of orders.

​For instance, if you had $1,000 in sales from 20 orders, your AOV is $50. Shopify displays this to help you understand how much, on average, customers spend per transaction. 

**Returning Customer Rate**: The percentage of your customers who are repeat buyers. This is a measure of customer loyalty and retention. Higher the better.

In Shopify, it’s defined as the number of customers who have placed more than one order divided by your total number of unique customers, over the time period, expressed as a percentage​. So, a returning customer rate of 20% means one in five customers has bought from you before.

**Return Rate**: This deals with product returns. It shows the percentage of items sold that were later returned. For example, a 5% return rate means that out of all items sold in the period, 5% were returned by customers. You’d ideally want your return rate to be as low as possible.

There are many other metrics available – for instance, Shopify can show you things like top products, sales by channel, sessions by device, etc. – but the ones above are some of the most commonly referenced on the overview screen.
