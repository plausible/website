Google Analytics is the largest web analytics platform. 84% of sites that use a known web analytics provider, use Google Analytics to track their visitors and get website statistics.

Google Analytics is a powerful and useful tool, but [here are some reasons](https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics) why some people look for alternatives:

* They want something more niche and specialized in different areas such as product analytics, funnels or heat maps
* They want something easier to understand and get insights from without needing to be an expert or without taking a lot of time
* They want something compliant with the different privacy regulations to [avoid cookies banners and other consent prompts](https://plausible.io/data-policy) 
* They want something more lightweight to optimize their site speed and performance
