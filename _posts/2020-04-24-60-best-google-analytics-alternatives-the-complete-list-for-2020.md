Google Analytics is the largest web analytics platform. 84% of sites that use a known web analytics provider, use Google Analytics to track their visitors and get website statistics.

Google Analytics is a powerful and useful tool, but [here are some reasons](https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics) why some people look for alternatives:

* They want something **more niche and specialized in different areas** such as product analytics, [funnels](https://plausible.io/blog/funnels-conversion-optimization) or heat maps
* They want something **easier to understand and get insights from** without needing to be an expert or without taking a lot of time
* They want something **compliant with the different privacy regulations** to [avoid cookies banners and other consent prompts](https://plausible.io/data-policy) 
* They want something **more lightweight to optimize their site speed** and performance
* They want something that's **open source and/or self-hostable** 

Are you looking for a Google Analytics alternative or a tool to use as an addition to Google Analytics? Here's the complete list of all the best website analytics tools you can choose from. Let's get started.
