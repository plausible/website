You can now select up to three existing custom properties and values directly in the goal settings. This lets you turn a broad goal into a more specific one, like a Purchase goal for logged in users or for a particular country.



T﻿his works with all types of goals: pageview goals, custom events and scroll goals.

Goals with properties behave like built-in segments. This would especially help make funnels more precise, since each step can now represent a specific version of a goal instead of a *catch all*.

P.S. Sending custom properties works exactly as before. You still send them in your event or goal snippet and can use them for filtering and breakdowns across the dashboard.
