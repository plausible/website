N﻿ow you can enable SSO for your team on Plausible. SSO gives you a way to access Plausible without having to create a separate account for Plausible and managing additional credentials. 

This is possible by first logging in to identity provider (IdP) - be it Google, Okta, Microsoft (Entra) or other - and accessing Plausible through it.

Our SSO implementation is SAML 2.0 compliant and it should be compatible with almost every identity provider as SAML 2.0 protocol is widely supported.

L﻿earn more about the implementation on our [docs](https://plausible.io/docs/sso), [contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) for enabling this feature.
