Previously, the "Compare" date ranges option allowed comparisons only for top metrics and the line graph.

Now, you can compare all dashboard metrics! Once you activate date range comparison (by clicking 'X' or using the time range selector), you'll see colour-coded arrows next to each metric, indicating improvements or declines compared to the previous period.

Hover over any arrow for a detailed breakdown.
