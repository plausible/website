Team owners can now make **two-factor authentication (2FA)** mandatory for all members. This helps teams keep their accounts and data even more secure.

You can manage your team’s 2FA settings in the Team Settings section.

W﻿e take security very seriously, here's an overview of everything you can do to keep your account secure:

* **Manage active sessions:** View and [remotely log out](https://plausible.io/docs/login-management) of any device from your account settings. All sessions automatically expire after 14 days of inactivity.
* **Password protection:** If you change your password, Plausible [automatically signs you out](https://plausible.io/docs/reset-password) of all other devices to keep your account safe.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Teams on eligible plans can [enable SSO](https://plausible.io/docs/sso) to make logging in simpler and more secure.

P.S. We’ve also made the dark theme even darker. If you prefer dark mode, [give it a try](https://plausible.io/docs/dashboard-appearance)!
