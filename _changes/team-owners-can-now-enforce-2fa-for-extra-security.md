W﻿e've made security in Plausible even stronger. 

**New**: Team owners can now make **two-factor authentication (2FA)** **mandatory** for all members. This helps teams keep their accounts and data even more secure. You can manage your team’s 2FA settings in the Team Settings section. Everything you need to know is [here](https://plausible.io/docs/2fa).

**Overview**: W﻿e take security very seriously, here's a reminder of everything you can do to keep your account secure:

* **Manage active sessions:** View and [remotely log out](https://plausible.io/docs/login-management) of any device from your account settings. All sessions automatically expire after 14 days of inactivity.
* **Password protection:** If you change your password, Plausible [automatically signs you out](https://plausible.io/docs/reset-password) of all other devices to keep your account safe.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Teams on eligible plans can [enable SSO](https://plausible.io/docs/sso) to make logging in simpler and more secure.

Beyond account-level security, we follow strict best practices: we don’t use cookies, don’t collect personal data, and encrypt all data in transit and at rest. We’re also fully GDPR, CCPA, and PECR compliant. Learn more about how we keep your data safe [here](https://plausible.io/security). 

P.S. We’ve also made the dark theme even darker. If you prefer dark mode, [give it a try](https://plausible.io/docs/dashboard-appearance)!
