You can now save segments for quick and easy access! When you create a segment using one or more filters, you will find a new option to save it along with a display name (e.g., *Organic signups*) and access it later from your "Filter" menu.

There are two types of segments you can create:

* **Personal Segments** – Save segments for your own use.
* **Site Segments** (business plan) – Share saved segments with your team members.
