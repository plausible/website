I﻿f you track your [revenue goals](https://plausible.io/docs/ecommerce-revenue-tracking) in Plausible, you can now see a breakdown of your revenue within the individual reports as well.

Whenever the revenue goal is applied on your dashboard and you expand any report (by clicking on "Details"), you will find a new "Revenue" column appear. This helps you see exactly which traffic sources, top/entry/exit pages, locations, browser/OS/device types, and custom properties contributed to how much revenue and make judgements on what drives value best.
