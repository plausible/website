We just released version 2.2.0 of the Plausible WordPress plugin. The highlight of this update is you can now track contact form submissions automatically, without any manual tagging or extra setup.

We have verified and tested this tracking with Contact Form 7, WP Forms, Ninja Forms and Elementor Forms but it should work for most other forms plugins as well.

To enable form tracking:

1. Go to the **“Enhanced measurements”** section in the Plausible WordPress plugin settings.
2. Toggle on **“Form completions”** tracking.

Once enabled, all successful form completions will be tracked and displayed in the **"Goal Conversions"** report in your Plausible Analytics dashboard.

You'll see a **"WP Form Completions"** goal appear once the first successful submission is recorded. If you have multiple forms on your site, you can click on this goal to see a breakdown by page.
