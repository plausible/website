You can now share a dashboard that shows data from only one segment. People opening the link will always see that segment and cannot remove it. They can add more filters, but they will not be able to see any data outside the selected segment. This makes it easy to share only the data you want with the right audience.

*add the limit to segment hashed link with this.*

### O﻿ther updates

* N﻿ow you will find a percentage column appear upon hovering over any report. This makes it easier to see what percentage of the total visitors each source, page, region, or device contributes.
