H﻿appy new year! Here are a few updates to kick off the new year. 🎈

## Limited dashboard sharing

When [sharing your dashboard](https://plausible.io/docs/shared-links) with external parties, you can now choose to show only specific, filtered data, i.e., [share only a segment of you stats](https://plausible.io/docs/shared-links#limit-to-segment).

People opening such a shared link will always see that segment and won't be able to remove it. They would be able to add more filters to drill down further, but they won't be able to see any data outside the selected segment. 

This makes it easy to share only the data you want with the right audience.

## O﻿ther updates

* You can now see what percentage of your visitors came from different traffic sources, locations, and devices, as well as what percentage visited each page. A percentage column appears when you hover over a report and when the report is expanded.
* Enterprise customers now have the option to access their event level data with [scheduled raw event data exports](https://plausible.io/docs/export-stats#scheduled-raw-event-data-exports).
