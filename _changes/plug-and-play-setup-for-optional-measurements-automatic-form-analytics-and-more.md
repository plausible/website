W﻿e have so many updates to share with you!

### 1. Brand new Plausible script for easier setup and more flexibility

The new Plausible script makes managing your analytics easier than ever. You can now enable or disable optional measurements (like outbound link clicks, file downloads, and form submissions) or even change your site’s domain — **all without changing your site snippet again**.

If you’re using the previous script, you’ll need to update to this new version once to take advantage of these improvements.

### 2. Introducing, automatic form submission tracking

[Form submissions tracking](https://plausible.io/docs/form-submissions-tracking) is now available as an optional measurement to track. Just toggle on to start tracking.

Plausible automatically detects and records all form submissions across your site, making it easy to measure signups, contact form conversions, etc.

### 3﻿. Official Google Tag Manager template

I﻿f you prefer installing/managing Plausible using Google Tag Manager, it's now way easier to do that. 

We’ve launched our [official GTM template](https://plausible.io/gtm-template), allowing you to set up Plausible through Google Tag Manager with a simple, code-free configuration. Best of both worlds!
