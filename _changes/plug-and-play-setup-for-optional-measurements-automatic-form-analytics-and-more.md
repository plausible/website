W﻿e have so many updates to share with you!

### 1. Simpler setup for optional measurements

Outbound link clicks, file downloads, and form submissions can now be enabled directly from your Site Installation settings — with no need to update your site snippet. Just toggle them on and start tracking instantly. 

### 2. Introducing, automatic form submission tracking

[Form submissions tracking](https://plausible.io/docs/form-submissions-tracking) is now available as an optional measurement to track. Just toggle on to start tracking.

Plausible automatically detects and records all form submissions across your site, making it easy to measure signups, contact form conversions and absolutely anything that is a form.

### 3﻿. Official Google Tag Manager template

I﻿f you prefer installing/managing Plausible using Google Tag Manager, it's now way easier to do that. 

We’ve launched our [official GTM template](https://plausible.io/gtm-template), allowing you to set up Plausible through Google Tag Manager with a simple, code-free configuration. Best of both worlds!

### 4﻿. Improved installation verification

Our script installation verification tool — which helps you confirm your Plausible script is installed correctly and troubleshoot setup issues — is now more powerful, accurate, and reliable.
