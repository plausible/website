The scroll depth metric is now available in your Plausible Analytics dashboard. You can find it in the Top Pages report or in your dashboard's top row when filtering by a page or pages.

W﻿e are tracking this metric automatically for all pages on your site—no setup required. We track scroll depth at all page heights––(1% to 100%).
