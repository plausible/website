The scroll depth metric is now available in your Plausible Analytics dashboard. You can find it in the Top Pages report or in your dashboard's top row when it's filtered by a page.

W﻿e are tracking this metric automatically for all pages on your site—no setup required. We track scroll depth at all page heights––(1% to 100%).

**Introducing P﻿age Scroll goals** 

You can set up a Scroll Depth goal with a specific scroll depth percentage threshold to see how many visitors scroll to and beyond your desired scroll depth mark. Learn more [here](https://plausible.io/docs/scroll-depth#scroll-depth-goals).
