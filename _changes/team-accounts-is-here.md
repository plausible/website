It's now much easier to manage teams on Plausible. You can now:

* Add multiple owners and billing contacts, so you're not stuck if someone’s away or has left the company.
* Invite multiple people to a site at once.
* Add someone to several sites in one go.

No more one-by-one invites. 

You’ll find the new **“Create a Team”** option in the upper-right menu. You can also view and switch between your teams there — and still access your personal sites under **“My Personal Sites”**.

Team roles include: Viewer, Editor, Admin, Billing, and Owner.
