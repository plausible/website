It's now much easier to manage teams on Plausible. You can now:

*  Add multiple owners and billing contacts, so you're not stuck if someone’s away or has left the company.
* Invite multiple people to a site at once.
* Add someone to several sites in one go.

No more one-by-one invites. 

F﻿ind the new "Create a Team" option i﻿n the upper right menu.
