You told us you loved the sticky header concept so it is now live! 😍 It makes it easier to:

* See the chosen time period and switch dates
* See the chosen filters and clear filters
* Get a filter drop-down menu when using many filters
* "This Month" is now "Month to Date" with a comparison to the previous period
