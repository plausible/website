If you want to recover the stats that would’ve otherwise gone missing because of a few ad blockers, you can [proxy](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/introduction) the Plausible script and endpoint through your own domain name, making it a first-party connection.

If you’d rather not deal with managing your own proxy, we can now handle it for you. Just set up a CNAME record using the instructions we’ll send you, update the snippet on your site, and that’s it—we’ll take care of the rest.

Managed proxy is available on our Enterprise plans. [Contact us for details](https://plausible.io/contact).
