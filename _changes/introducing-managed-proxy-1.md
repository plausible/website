I﻿f you want your Plausible script to bypass some ad blockers for more accurate stats, you can [proxy](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/introduction) the Plausible script and endpoint through your own domain name, making it a first-party connection.

**W﻿hat's new**: If you’d rather not deal with managing your own proxy, we can now handle it for you. Just set up a CNAME record using the instructions we’ll send you, update the snippet on your site, and we’ll take care of the rest.

Managed proxy is available on our Enterprise plans, [contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) for details.
