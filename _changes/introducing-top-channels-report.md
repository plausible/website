You can now find the all-new Top Channels report on your dashboard. It automatically groups your traffic into key marketing channels like Direct, Organic Search, Referral, Paid Social, and more. For a full list of channels, check out our [documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/top-referrers#channels).

When you click on any channel, your dashboard will filter to show the sources under that category. For example, Organic Search will display sources like Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc.

This gives you a complete view of your most effective marketing channels in one place, without the need to manually combine data from different reports. You can easily track key metrics like unique visits, engagement, bounce rates, goal conversions, etc., by channel, helping you make more targeted optimizations and focus your marketing efforts where theyâ€™ll have the greatest impact.
