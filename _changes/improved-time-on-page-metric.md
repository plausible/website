We’ve made some big upgrades to how the "Time on Page" metric works:

* **M﻿ore accurate tracking:** Prior to 1 March 2025, the Time on Page was calculated as the difference between the point a visitor landed on a page and when they moved on to the next page. The new tracking method relies on engagement signals. This allows us to provide you with a more precise and reliable measure of user engagement which includes visitors who bounce away from your pages and which does not include time not spent actively on your pages.
* **View it on the top graph:** You can now click on the Time on Page metric to see how it trends over time (available for date ranges starting 1 March 2025). 
* **Sort by it:** In the Top Pages Details view, you can now sort pages by Time on Page to quickly see where visitors spend the most (or least) time.

W﻿hen viewing data for periods before 1 March 2025, the legacy Time on Page metric is displayed along with a note in the tooltip.
