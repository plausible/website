## What are web analytics?

Web analytics is the process of measuring and analyzing the usage of a website. Website owners use the analytics data to assess the performance of a site, to figure out what they're doing well and what no so well and to see what they can do to improve and optimize their future efforts.

## Google Analytics is a complex tool that requires education

Google Analytics is the most popular web analytics tool. It is installed on and is tracking website traffic on [85% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/traffic_analysis) that use known web analytics tools. Google Analytics is widely spread but it is far from being an easy and simple site analytics tool to use.

When you open your Google Analytics, you're welcomed with a very busy page full of analytics metrics. On the navigational menu on the left-hand side, you have ten different sections. Opening each of these ten menu items, we can count more than 40 sub-sections.

More than 20 of these sub-sections have additional menu items within them. The total count of these additional menu items is at more than 85 reports.

So in total, Google Analytics on the left-hand side navigation menu has more than 125 items for different reports you can gather your insights from. All these different reports track more than 290 different metrics combined.

That's a full-time job which requires a lot of time, effort, expertise and experience to do well. Many Google Analytics users end up needing to create their own custom dashboards where they add different widgets with useful metrics that they actually get value from.

Then they ignore everything else that Google Analytics tracks. Many just ignore it completely as it's overwhelming to even start with.

Google Analytics is a powerful but complex web analytics tool that takes time to understand, requires training and education. It collects way too many data points and most people find real and regular use for only a fraction of the data it measures.

It is a maximalist and overkill solution for most website owners. This is what made us build Plausible and why we believe Plausible is [a great Google Analytics alternative](https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics).

## Plausible a simple web analytics tool

Plausible cuts through all that noise that Google Analytics creates. Plausible is more simple to use as it tracks a smaller number of metrics and presents them on an easier to understand dashboard.

Rather than tracking every metric imaginable, many of them that you will never find a use for, Plausible focuses on the most essential website stats only.

There is no navigational menu. There are no additional sub-menus. There is no need to create custom reports. We provide you with a simple and useful web analytics dashboard out of the box.

It is easy to use and understand with no training or prior experience. Everything you need to know about your website traffic is on one page:

1. Choose the time range that you want to analyze. The visitor numbers are automatically presented on an hourly, daily or monthly graph. The default time frame is set at the last 30 days.
2. See the number of unique visitors, total page views and the bounce rate. These metrics include a percentage comparison to the previous time period so you understand if the trends are going up or down.
3. Right below that you see all the top referral sources of traffic and all the most visited pages on your site. Bounce rates of the individual referrals and pages are included too.
4. Underneath the referral sources and the most visited pages, you see the list of countries your traffic is coming from. You can also see the device, browser and operating system your visitors are using.
5. Last but not least, you can even track events and goals to identify the number of converted visitors, conversion rate, to understand who is converting and the referral sites that send the traffic that converts the best.

With Plausible, you get all the important web analytics at a glance so you can focus on creating a better site.
