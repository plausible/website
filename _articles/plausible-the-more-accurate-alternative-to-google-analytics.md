description: How Plausible provides much more accurate data than Google Analytics

“Every number in your Google Analytics account is wrong.” That is exactly what an independent [study](https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/inaccurate-google-analytics-traffic-sources/) recently done by Orbit Media found. 

This happens due to a bunch of reasons like consent banner declines, spam and bot traffic skewing data, tracking scripts being blocked by privacy-conscious browsers and ad blockers, and more such reasons we discuss in this post.

Google Analytics has been unable to provide solid solutions to these common problems and site owners continue operating with semi-accurate and missing data.

This is what we see regularly in our support tickets too: how they are seeing more numbers in their Plausible dashboard than in their GA dashboard.

We, at Plausible, take special measures in addressing challenges that pull down data accuracy. Let’s look at the reasons that affect data accuracy and what we do differently at Plausible to ensure accurate data and real insights.
