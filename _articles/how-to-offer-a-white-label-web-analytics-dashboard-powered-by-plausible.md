We've made it easy for you to provide or resell a white label version of our simple and privacy-centric web analytics dashboard to your customers. We've built several features to make it easy to integrate web analytics powered by Plausible (but without our branding) directly into your user interface.

Many SaaS startups already offer web analytics to their customers using Plausible. One example is Prezly, a storytelling platform that provides a site builder and a newsletter tool, among other services. 

Prezly is providing Plausible Analytics powered web analytics to thousands of their customers, including Shopify, Sennheiser and many other international brands. Read more [in their announcement](https://www.prezly.com/help/analytics-dashboard).

## What is Plausible Analytics?

Plausible provides easy to use, intuitive, lightweight and privacy-first web analytics. We don't collect personal data, we don't use cookies or other long-term identifiers. We exclusively use EU-owned infrastructure, ensuring visitor stats never leave the EU.

Your customers get a simple yet powerful and fast-loading analytics dashboard featuring all the important metrics at a glance which allows them to focus on creating a better site. The dashboard is easy to use and understand with no training or prior experience required.

You can see an example in [this live demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io) which features real world traffic from our own website. For further details on features and capabilities of Plausible, do take a look at [our documentation](https://plausible.io/docs).

Plausible is trusted by thousands of paying subscribers. We're a completely independent, self-funded and bootstrapped startup launched in 2019. We're operating a sustainable project funded solely by the fees that our subscribers pay us.

Here are the features we've built to help you resell or provide a white label analytics dashboard powered by Plausible to your customers:

## Sites API to manage a large number of sites programmatically

Sites API allows you to add and manage a large number of sites programmatically. You can add sites, delete sites or change domain names using the sites API.

Note also that you don't necessarily need to install our snippet on the same domain as the domain you have added to your Plausible account. Think of the domain in Plausible more like a site ID rather than an exact match. This allows you more flexibility in your setup all depending on your situation.

Using the sites API, you can also add or delete goals and custom events. Goals and custom events allow you track actions that you want visitors to take on a site. 

Actions such as signing up to a newsletter, clicking on a "Download" button, registering for an account, purchasing a product, clicking on an external link, downloading a file or completing a checkout form of an ecommerce store.

You can set these up for your customers so they can automatically track actions without any additional effort. You can learn more about [goals and custom events here](https://plausible.io/docs/goal-conversions).

The sites API also allows you to create shared links, which you then use to embed the dashboard into your product or user interface. Read more below.

See our [sites API documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/sites-api).

## Embed dashboard to integrate our stats into your user interface

Embed dashboard allows you to embed our default dashboard (without Plausible branding) into your user interface. You get our modern, fast-loading and fully featured web analytics without any need for you to build a dashboard yourself.

The embed dashboard allows you to select the dashboard's theme (light, dark or system) or optionally choose a custom background color too. You can change CSS rules to make sure that the embedded dashboard aligns with your site design. 

You can also apply filters to the embed dashboard to segment the audience. These filters will be automatically added to your embed dashboard every time it's loaded. You can read more about [filtering and segmenting here](https://plausible.io/docs/filters-segments).

Learn more about [the embed dashboard functionality here](https://plausible.io/docs/embed-dashboard).

## Stats API for complete flexibility

Stats API allows you to take individual metrics and create a custom-built dashboard within your user interface in whichever shape or form you want. Show one particular metric only or build a fully featured dashboard from scratch. It's all possible. 

While the Stats API requires more development time than the embedded dashboard option, it offers complete flexibility.

Do you prefer to offer a fully featured dashboard but also display specific metrics in certain sections of your user interface? Stats API can also be used in combination with the embedded dashboard.

See our [stats API documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api).

## Proxy to eliminate third-party calls

Proxy allows you to run our lightweight web analytics script as a first-party connection from your domain name eliminating third-party calls. Another benefit of this approach is that you'll be getting [more accurate stats](https://plausible.io/most-accurate-web-analytics), as content blockers don't typically block first-party scripts.

You can proxy requests to Plausible in various ways, all depending on how you've built your product and on your hosting situation. And if you don't want to manage your own proxy, we can handle it for you with our managed proxy. Our managed proxy helps bypass adblockers and count more traffic without any setup or maintenance on your end.

Learn more about [the proxy functionality](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/introduction).

## Consolidated View for a holistic look at your network

Consolidated View functionality aggregates stats from all of your sites and allows you to see them in one combined dashboard while keeping the individual site stats on their own separate dashboards. 

It allows you to keep all your global traffic in one dashboard for internal purposes but also share the traffic from individual tenant sites with the particular client only. 

This way you can get detailed insights into individual site performance and a holistic view of your whole network too.
