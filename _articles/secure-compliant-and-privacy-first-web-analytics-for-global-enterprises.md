Plausible Analytics is loved by small and large organizations that run many websites together, handle high volumes of traffic and work under strict privacy and security requirements.

Plausible has been trusted for years by organizations such as Hugging Face, Sentry, the Python Software Foundation, the Steve Jobs Archive, the Rails Foundation, Harvard University, the Scottish and Welsh governments – just to name a few.

As of early 2026, Plausible is used by 16,000+ paying subscribers worldwide, including 600+ enterprise accounts.

If you’re looking for a web analytics tool that can cover your needs right from handling high volumes of data, privacy-friendliness, accuracy of stats, state-of-the-art security practices, and is still easy to use, here’s everything you need to know.

## Privacy-first analytics by default

We built Plausible from the ground up to respect privacy by design, while still giving you meaningful, accurate, complete insights. We do not collect personal data or use cookies, and we never track individuals across sites, devices or over time.

All the data we collect is aggregated and focused on overall trends, not on identifying people. You get all information on a [simple and useful dashboard](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics) without ever having to worry about your customers' privacy (at least from our end).

You fully own and control your website data. We claim no rights to it, never collect personal data, never sell or share your data, and always respect your visitors’ privacy.

For understanding more on how this works and why it matters, see our [privacy-focused analytics page](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

For large organizations operating across multiple regions, this approach also simplifies privacy reviews and lowers your long-term risk.

## Reliable security

We built security into Plausible at every layer. Our infrastructure is configured with strong access controls, encrypted connections and continuous monitoring to help prevent and detect threats. 

Access to production systems is limited to a small set of trusted team members, and we regularly review our practices. We also monitor dependencies and apply updates proactively to reduce risk.

Being open source makes sure we hold up to high standards. Our entire code base and the development are available to the public so they can be independently audited and verified by third-party experts for security or compliance.

Plausible is updated several times a week. We run a growing set of automated tests after every code change to help ensure the software stays reliable and high quality.

For more details on how we secure our systems and infrastructure, see our [full security documentation](https://plausible.io/security).

## Easy compliance

Plausible is designed to respect privacy and comply with relevant privacy laws by default. We do not collect personal data, do not use cookies for tracking and we do not build individual user profiles.

Because of this, Plausible can be used in a way that aligns with regulations like GDPR, PECR and CCPA for many common use cases. An independent [review](https://plausible.io/blog/legal-assessment-gdpr-eprivacy) by a data protection lawyer backs this claim.

You can even [avoid cookie consent banners](https://plausible.io/blog/cookie-consent-banners#but-can-you-avoid-the-cookie-consent-banners) by using Plausible, which not only makes compliance easier but makes your website experience much better.

We offer a [Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://plausible.io/dpa) and clear documentation around how data is handled and retained so your legal and compliance teams can review and approve the arrangement. You always retain ownership of your analytics data.

While Plausible is engineered to support regulatory compliance out of the box, this information does not constitute legal advice. We recommend that you review our documentation and consult your legal team to confirm suitability for your specific context.

## Accurate stats

Plausible is designed to show real numbers, not modeled or estimated data. We do not use sampling, statistical modeling, and we do not change historical data.

As we do not apply thresholds, sampling or data blending, your numbers do not suddenly change when traffic increases. What you see today is directly comparable to what you saw last week or last year, making Plausible suitable for long-term reporting, forecasting and internal reviews.

You’ll also generally see a much better accuracy in your stats because our tracking script is not blocked or denied by ad blockers or privacy-respecting browsers, or cookie consent banners. Because of this reason alone, you’ll see 55% more data available in Plausible as compared to GA4 ([study proves](https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/inaccurate-google-analytics-traffic-sources/)).

Our bot detection system also ensures that you never have to worry about excluding bot or even spam traffic yourself.

Our data is also always fresh and constantly updated. We provide real-time analytics.

## Built for large teams and high-traffic sites

Plausible can handle any number of pageviews/events on your sites, all you need to do is let us know about your requirement. The largest site in our network currently gets ~one billion pageviews per month, but that is not the upper limit for us.

You can also have any number of sites and different [teams](https://plausible.io/docs/users-roles#working-with-your-team) on your Plausible account. Your data stays accurate and easy to understand, whether you are analyzing one site or hundreds.

If your website or websites exceed 10 million monthly pageviews including custom events, or you need 10+ sites, or 10+ team members and/or higher API limits, a custom Enterprise plan is required.

## Enterprise-only features for advanced needs

You can get access to the following enterprise-only features, depending upon the custom plan you decide with us.

### Single Sign-On (SSO) for centralized access control

We can enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your team to log in to Plausible using your existing identity provider.

This removes the need to create and manage separate user accounts, streamlines onboarding and offboarding, and aligns with internal security and compliance requirements. 

Plausible supports the SAML 2.0 protocol, which works with most identity providers like Google Workspace, Okta and Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), so you can guard access using your corporate identity platform. Find [all info here](https://plausible.io/docs/sso).

### Managed proxy for more complete data 

Some browsers and adblockers block requests to analytics services by default, which can lead to gaps in your data.

A [proxy](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/introduction) lets you run Plausible’s tracking script and event API through your own domain instead of sending them directly to *plausible.io*, essentially making analytics look like a first-party connection from your site. This helps reduce blocking and gives you a more complete picture of user behavior.

With Managed Proxy on the Enterprise plan, we handle the setup and maintenance for you. You simply point a CNAME from your domain to the proxy endpoint we provide and update the script snippet on your site. 

We take care of the rest behind the scenes, so you get the benefits of a first-party connection without the operational overhead.

### Scheduled raw event data exports for deeper analysis

You can get access to the raw event data so you can run custom queries, build your own reports, or feed internal dashboards and data warehouses.

With scheduled raw event data exports on the Enterprise plan, you can automatically export your event data on a regular schedule. Exports include all events tracked by Plausible (pageviews and custom events) in a simple format that works with tools like BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, or your own internal systems.

Once set up, these exports run automatically and deliver your data where you need it, without manual steps. This makes it easier to combine Plausible data with other sources, perform deeper analysis, and meet internal reporting or compliance requirements.

### Sites API

The Plausible Site provisioning API offers a way to create and manage sites in your Plausible account programmatically. This is useful if you run many websites or if you're offering a web analytics dashboard powered by Plausible to your customers.

You can learn more about [white labeling](https://plausible.io/white-label-web-analytics) here. For full technical details on the Sites API and how to use it, see our [documentation](https://plausible.io/docs/sites-api).

### Other Enterprise features

In addition to the features above, Enterprise plans offer:

* **5+ years of data retention**, making it easier to analyze trends over time, compare performance year over year and meet internal reporting requirements.
* **Higher API limits**, including 600+ Stats API requests per hour
* **Priority support** with faster response times and direct access to the Plausible team when issues or questions arise.

## Other features to make your Plausible experience smooth

As an enterprise subscriber, you get access to all [business features](https://plausible.io/#pricing), some of which are worth mentioning here:

* Set weekly/monthly performance [reports](https://plausible.io/docs/email-reports) to be sent through email
* [Import](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import) your GA4 data for a smooth transition
* Use the official [Looker Studio Connector](https://plausible.io/docs/looker-studio) or the [Search Console integration](https://plausible.io/docs/google-search-console-integration)
* Setup all kinds of [goals](https://plausible.io/docs/goal-conversions) and [funnel](https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis) f﻿or conversion analysis
* Track easily across different [subdomains/hostnames](https://plausible.io/docs/subdomain-hostname-filter')
* Use segments for [audience segmentation](https://plausible.io/audience-segmentation) and deeper analysis

## Talk to us about an Enterprise plan

We offer Enterprise plans for organizations that need more flexibility than our standard plans provide. You can choose any combination of higher limits, enterprise features, or both.

We’ll work with you to put together a custom Enterprise plan that fits your usage, requirements and internal workflows. If your legal or procurement team needs to review any of our documents or has questions about how our security practices or data processing work in practice, we’re happy to help clarify.

Unlike many B2B enterprise tools, our Enterprise plans don’t come with long-term contracts or lock-ins. You can start on an Enterprise plan, upgrade or downgrade as your needs change, or cancel at any time. Plausible is offered under our standard terms of service, privacy policy, data policy and data processing agreement. These documents are publicly available and apply equally to all subscribers.

If you haven’t already, take a look at the Plausible [demo](https://plausible.io/plausible.io) dashboard (which is our very own analytics publicly live). Feel free to get started with a [free trial](https://plausible.io/register) and take Plausible for a ride.
