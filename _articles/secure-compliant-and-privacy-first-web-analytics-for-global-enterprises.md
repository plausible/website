Plausible Analytics is loved by small and large organizations that run many websites together, handle high volumes of traffic and work under strict privacy and security requirements.

Plausible has been trusted for years by organizations such as Hugging Face, Sentry, the Python Software Foundation, the Steve Jobs Archive, the Rails Foundation, Harvard University, the Scottish and Welsh governments – just to name a few.

As of early 2026, Plausible is used by more than 17,000 paying subscribers worldwide, including 600+ enterprise accounts.

If you’re looking for a web analytics tool that can cover your needs right from privacy-friendliness, accuracy of stats, handling large volumes of data, state-of-the-art security practices, and is still easy to use, here’s everything you need to know.

## Privacy-first analytics by default

We built Plausible from the ground up to respect privacy by design, while still giving you meaningful, accurate, complete insights. We do not collect personal data or use cookies, and we never track individuals across sites, devices or over time.

All the data we collect is aggregated and focused on overall trends, not on identifying people. You get all information on a [simple and useful dashboard](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics) without ever having to worry about your customers' privacy (at least from our end).

You fully own and control your website data. We claim no rights to it, never collect personal data, never sell or share your data, and always respect your visitors’ privacy.

For understanding more on how this works and why it matters, see our [privacy-focused analytics page](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

For large organizations operating across multiple regions, this approach also simplifies privacy reviews and lowers your long-term risk.

## Reliable security

We built security into Plausible at every layer. Our infrastructure is configured with strong access controls, encrypted connections and continuous monitoring to help prevent and detect threats. 

Access to production systems is limited to a small set of trusted team members, and we regularly review our practices. We also monitor dependencies and apply updates proactively to reduce risk.

Being open source makes sure we hold up to high standards. Our entire code base and the development are available to the public so they can be independently audited and verified by third-party experts for security or compliance.

Plausible is updated several times a week. We run a growing set of automated tests after every code change to help ensure the software stays reliable and high quality.

For more details on how we secure our systems and infrastructure, see our [full security documentation](https://plausible.io/security).

## Easy compliance

Plausible is designed to respect privacy and comply with relevant privacy laws by default. We do not collect personal data, do not use cookies for tracking and we do not build individual user profiles.

Because of this, Plausible can be used in a way that aligns with regulations like GDPR, PECR and CCPA for many common use cases. An independent [review](https://plausible.io/blog/legal-assessment-gdpr-eprivacy) by a data protection lawyer backs this claim.

You can even [avoid cookie consent banners](https://plausible.io/blog/cookie-consent-banners#but-can-you-avoid-the-cookie-consent-banners) by using Plausible, which not only makes compliance easier but makes your website experience much better.

We offer a [Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://plausible.io/dpa) and clear documentation around how data is handled and retained so your legal and compliance teams can review and approve the arrangement. You always retain ownership of your analytics data.

While Plausible is engineered to support regulatory compliance out of the box, this information does not constitute legal advice. We recommend that you review our documentation and consult your legal team to confirm suitability for your specific context.
