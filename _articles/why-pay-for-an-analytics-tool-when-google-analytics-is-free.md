Google Analytics has been the staple of the digital marketing industry. It is the most commonly adopted web analytics tool on the internet, that itâ€™s a habitâ€“â€“a no-brainerâ€“â€“for site owners to install and use it for tracking site performance.

And because itâ€™s always been free to use, that is part of the habit as well. This makes many people wonder why pay for an analytics tool when Google Analyticsâ€“â€“the go-to toolâ€“â€“is available for free. ðŸ¤·
