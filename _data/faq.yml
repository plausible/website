- question: I've integrated Plausible into my site. How do I check if I've done it correctly?
  answer: "We have instructions on how you can <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/troubleshoot-integration'>check your Plausible integration and troubleshoot any possible issues</a>."

- question: Where are your servers located and where is the data stored?
  answer: "We exclusively use EU-owned cloud infrastructure. The site data we collect is stored in Falkenstein, Germany on servers owned by Hetzner, a European company. Your site data <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-illegal'>never leaves the EU and EU owned infrastructure</a>."

- question: Is the billing based per account or per website?
  answer: "The billing is based on the total number of pageviews between all of the sites you have added to your account. You can see this total number of billable pageviews at any time in your account settings."

- question: How do I add my business details and the VAT number?
  answer: "You can add your company address and VAT number on the payment screen during the upgrade process. You can also open any of your previous invoices and click on the Add address & VAT Number link to do so."
    
- question: How do I get an invoice?
  answer: "Our payment processor Paddle sends an invoice to you via email automatically upon each payment. You can click on a link within this email to download your invoice. You can also <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/download-invoices'>download your invoices</a> in your Plausible account settings."
    
- question: Do you support any alternative payment methods?
  answer: "Credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay are the supported payment methods. We cannot accept payments by wire transfer, invoicing or cryptocurrency unfortunately."

- question: What happens if I go over my monthly page views limit?
  answer: "You will never be charged extra for an occasional traffic spike. We will not stop counting your stats either. There are no surprise fees and your card will never be charged unexpectedly. Suppose new higher traffic levels become your new standard and your page views exceed your subscription plan for two consecutive months. In that case, we kindly ask you to upgrade your subscription plan to accommodate your new traffic levels using our self-serve platform."

- question: How does the billing work if I upgrade my subscription to a higher tier?
  answer: "Our payment processor Paddle will calculate a pro-rated amount which reflects the amount you have paid on your previous subscription and the amount of time until that subscription was supposed to expire."

- question: Can I give someone access to my stats without making the dashboard public?
  answer: "You can <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/users-roles'>invite team members and assign user roles</a> in your site settings. Or you can use our <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/shared-links'>private and secure shared links</a>. These can be password protected too. The person you share the link with doesn't need to have a Plausible account and they can see the individual dashboard but cannot see anything else that you have on your account."

- question: Is there a hard limit on the number of sites, team members or API requests per hour?
  answer: "No. There are no hard limits on the number of sites, the number of team members or the number of API requests per hour that you can have in your Plausible account. To modify the limits of your plan, please contact us. We're here to help tailor your subscription plan to your needs."
  
- question: Can I integrate your dashboard into my UI and offer it to my customers?
  answer: "Yes. We have built several features to make it easy to integrate web analytics powered by Plausible (but without our branding) directly into your user interface. <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/white-label-web-analytics'>See more here</a>."

- question: Can I track visitors across my domain and subdomain?
  answer: "Yes. You can use the same snippet on both the domain name and its subdomain. This allows you to see the visitor journey end-to-end from the landing on the main domain name to a conversion on the subdomain. <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/plausible-script#can-i-track-visitors-across-my-domain-and-subdomain'>More details here</a>."
  
- question: Do you have a roll-up view with aggregated stats for several sites?
  answer: "Yes. Rollup reporting allows you to aggregate stats from multiple sites and see them all together in one dashboard while still keeping the individual site stats on its own separate dashboard. <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/plausible-script#is-there-a-roll-up-view'>More details here</a>."
  
- question: Does Plausible get blocked by adblockers and how do I avoid that?
  answer: "We're not blocked to the same extent as Google Analytics (neither Firefox, Chrome nor Safari blocks Plausible out of the box) but we're blocked by some adblock browser extensions. You can use <a class='text-indigo-600' href='https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/introduction'>a proxy</a> if you want to count visitors that use adblockers too."
  
- question: Do you have a free plan?
  answer: "We don't have a free plan unfortunately. Plausible is independent and funded solely by the fees that our subscribers pay us. We're not monetizing the data we collect so a subscription fee is needed to cover our costs and salaries. Thanks for understanding!"
